images/Teileuebersicht,Check whether all the parts are there.
images/ESP_pins,First solder the two pin headers into the ESP{,} so that the long side of the pin headers is facing down; you can use the outdoor fox board as an aid{,} so that the pin headers sit straight; plug the pin headers into the outdoor fox board and then plug the ESP on top; this will keep the pin headers in place and you can solder them to the ESP.
images/Antenne,Next{,} solder the antenna into the hole provided in the radio module;There is already some tin in the hole{,} add a little more and insert the antenna through the hole{,} while the tin is still liquid;Make sure that the antenna is at right angles to the circuit board.
images/Platine_Kabel,Then you can cut off two pieces about 3-4 cm long from the red and black cable of the battery holder; solder the red cable into the hole labeled 5V on the outdoor fox board; solder the black cable into the hole labeled GND.
images/ESP_platine,Now you can insert the ESP into the third row of the circuit board; once this is done{,} you can solder it in place from below; then you have to cut off the protruding legs; do not use electronics side cutters for this{,} but a slightly more stable one.
images/Funkmodul_platine,Next{,} insert the radio module with the four connections into the outdoor fox board{,} so that the side with the components faces away from the ESP; now you can solder it on from below; make sure that the boards are at right angles to each other.
images/Kabel_spannungswandler,Next{,} we solder the two cables from the outdoor fox board to the step-up module; the red cable goes into the hole labeled 5V{,} the black one into the one labeled GND; pay attention to the orientation of the cables - they should lie flat over the components of the voltage converter.
images/Halter_einbau,Now slide all the circuit boards into the 3D-printed holder; finally{,} solder the two cables of the battery holder to the step-up module; the black one goes into the hole labeled GND{,} the red one into the one labeled 5V.
images/thumbnail,If you wish{,} you can attach the 3D-printed holder to the battery holder with double-sided adhesive tape (or superglue); however{,} this is not absolutely necessary.
images/frame,If you don't already have a flashed ESP{,} you need to flash it now; scan the QR code or open this link in your browser: https://wiki.blinkyparts.com/de/Bausaetze/Draussenfuchs
