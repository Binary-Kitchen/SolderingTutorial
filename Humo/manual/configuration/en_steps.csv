images/PXL_20231105_135642147_edit,Attention: The fan has an airflow direction. The airflow direction can be recognised by the arrow embossed on the black plastic on the side of the fan. The airflow direction should point outwards (towards the fan guard); Make sure that the cables come out where the small rectangular hole in the wooden part is (on the left in the picture); Screw the fan guard and the rear panel onto the fan using the fan screws (thick screws black or silver).
images/PXL_20231105_140907147,The fan has two{,} or three cables. Cut the black cable to a length of 4--5 cm; Cut the red cable to a length of 19--20 cm; (If existing) cut the third cable completely. Remove about 5--7 mm of insulation from the ends of the wires{,} so that the bare copper is visible.
images/PXL_20231105_140341088,Glue the small U-shaped piece of wood onto the bottom part (the piece of wood with the engraved silhouette of the U-shaped piece of wood).
images/PXL_20231105_142430801,Attention: Be careful with this step. The wood breaks very easily; press the rocker switch carefully into the rectangular hole in the piece of wood labelled "Humo". Make sure that the two metal contacts are facing outwards (left in the picture).
images/PXL_20231105_143519471,In the next step we use the previously cut cable from the fan;Optional (if present): First cut the connector off the cable;Remove about 2--4 mm of insulation from one side of the black and red cable;Solder the red cable to the pole of the LED strip labelled "+" (plus) (from which end does not matter);Solder the black cable to the pole of the LED strip labelled "-" (minus) (on the same end as the red cable).
images/PXL_20231105_143719208,Glue the LED strip to the underside of the wooden part labelled "Humo". The cables should look in the same direction as the switch (on the right in the picture).
images/PXL_20231105_144104593,Pull the two cables of the LED strip from the front through the small hole in the wooden part with the eyes;Pull the cable back until you can put the "Humo" wooden part onto the wooden part with eyes (see picture).
images/PXL_20231105_144958422,We now use the remaining extra cable or the extra cable supplied; Remove about 5--7 mm of insulation from the remaining cable (usually white or yellow). Solder the remaining cable to a metal pin of the rocker switch;Cut the red cable of the LED strip back{,} so that you can simply solder it to the other metal pin of the rocker switch. Don't leave the cable too long. Remove about 5--7 mm of insulation from the red cable and solder it to the other metal pins of the rocker switch.
images/PXL_20231105_145326075,Now take the red cable{,} that is still attached to the fan and solder it to the same side of the rocker switch as the red cable of the LED strip.
images/PXL_20231105_145824657,Guide the cable ends all down the side of the fan;Tip: You can use a piece of adhesive tape to organise the cables.;It may be that the switch is catching on a plastic rib on the fan. You can simply cut the rib with side cutters until it fits.
images/PXL_20231105_154601350,Tip: Use clamps or masking tape to fix the wooden parts for the glue to dry; Glue the "Humo" wooden part to the two plugged wooden parts (the ones with the fan and the eyes); Glue the two side parts{,} so that the side is facing forwards and the logo is visible on the side;Attention: Do not glue the bottom part yet!
images/PXL_20231105_155038215,Insert the spacer (wooden part with 4 rectangular holes) and activated charcoal filter into the Humo as shown. If it is too tight{,} you can cut the activated charcoal filter to size with scissors.
images/PXL_20231105_160312570-EDIT,Shorten the cables so{,} that you can easily solder them to the USBC adapter (12V Power Delivery); Solder the two black cables to the soldering pad of the USBC adapter marked with "-" (minus); Solder the remaining cable (white or yellow) to the soldering pad of the USBC adapter marked with "+" (plus); Tip: In this case{,} tin only the cable.; Insert the cables from above (from where the USBC plug can be seen) through the holes at "-" (minus) and "+" (plus) and bend the cable ends slightly. This holds everything together. Then set the soldering points.
images/PXL_20231210_095004075-EDIT,Glue the USBC adapter into the U-shaped piece of wood using superglue. The USBC connection should face outwards.
images/PXL_20231210_104943534,Insert the base so that the USBC connection is visible through the cut-out in the rear part; this piece of wood should not be glued so that the activated charcoal filter can be changed from time to time; you can secure the base with masking tape.
images/PXL_20210103_183919119,Screw the arms to your Humo.
images/thumbnail,You are now ready!; Plug the Humo into a USB port (Power Delivery PD 12V must be supported) and switch on the fan and the light.;You can now oil{,} paint or varnish{,} your Humo{,} but this is optional.
