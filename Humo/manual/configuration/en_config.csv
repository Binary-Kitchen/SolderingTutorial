   \item Magnets are included in the kit. Magnets are not toys! Make sure that the magnets do not get into the hands of children. Children can swallow small magnets. If several magnets are swallowed, they can become lodged in the intestines and cause life-threatening complications.
   \item Magnets can affect the function of pacemakers and implanted defibrillators. A pacemaker can be switched to test mode and cause discomfort. A defibrillator may no longer function. As the wearer of such devices, keep a sufficient distance from magnets. Warn wearers of such devices against approaching magnets.
   \item magnets generate a far-reaching, strong magnetic field. They can damage televisions and laptops, computer hard drives, credit and debit cards, data carriers, mechanical watches, hearing aids and loudspeakers, among other things. Keep magnets away from all devices and objects that can be damaged by strong magnetic fields.
   \item Neodymium magnets are brittle. If two magnets collide, they can shatter. Sharp-edged splinters can be thrown meters away and injure your eyes. Avoid collisions between magnets. Wear safety goggles when handling large magnets. Make sure that bystanders are also protected or keep their distance.
