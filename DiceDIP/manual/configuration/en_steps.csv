images/DSC04775,Tips:;Resistor value can be determined by color coding;Alignment of the board so{,} that Binary Kitchen e.V. can be read normally (see picture);Alignment for resistors does not matter;LEDs have a flat side and a shorter leg. Both indicate the negative side
images/DSC04776,Solder both IC sockets (Only the socket{,} not the actual IC device) with the nose up on the board;Attention: Do not solder the IC but only the IC socket;Note the pin count: IC1 with 14 pins left{,} IC2 with 16 pins right
images/DSC04779,Solder resistors R1 \usePart{R1|R3} (\SI{2,2}{\kilo\ohm}) and R2 \usePart{R2} (\SI{1}{\mega\ohm});orientation does not matter
images/DSC04780,Solder resistors R3 \usePart{R1|R3} (\SI{2,2}{\kilo\ohm}) and R4 \usePart{R4} (\SI{2,2}{\mega\ohm}); orientation does not matter.
images/DSC04781,\begin{flushleft}Solder resistors R5~\usePart{R5} (\SI{120}{\kilo\ohm}){,} R6~\usePart{R6|R8} (\SI{1,5}{\kilo\ohm}){,} R7~\usePart{R7} (\SI{1,8}{\kilo\ohm}){,} R8~\usePart{R6|R8} (\SI{1,5}{\kilo\ohm}) and R9~\usePart{R9} (\SI{3,3}{\kilo\ohm})\end{flushleft}; orientation does not matter.
images/DSC04782,Attention! Orientation of diodes is important;solder diodes D1 to D3 (BAW76) with black side towards white mark on PCB;solder diode D10 (1N4007) with white side towards white mark on PCB
images/DSC04783,Solder capacitors C1 (104) and C2 (104);orientation does not matter
images/DSC04784,Attention! Orientation of the transistor is important;solder transistor T1 (BC547) according to the marking;orientation: flat side downwards
images/DSC04785,Attention! Alignment of this capacitor is important;Solder capacitor C3 (\SI{47}{\micro\farad}) with long leg (+) downwards; Hint: There is a plus sign printed on the board.
images/DSC04786,Solder switch S1; Hint: Legs have different distances. Nothing has to be bent. Switch fits exactly; Some pressure may be necessary
images/DSC04787,Attention! Alignment of LED is crucial;Solder LED 1-7. Alignment important! Short leg upwards
images/DSC04788,Solder power connector X1 with opening upwards;As an alternative{,} the cables can also be soldered directly (VCC red{,} GND black); before doing so{,} guide the cable through the hole next to the connection and tie it in a knot (strain relief).
images/thumbnail,Connect battery holder (VCC red{,} GND black);Insert both ICs into the sockets (count the number of legs! There are differences here);Insert batteries;Push button. Done;Cube goes off again by itself
