images/PXL_20201204_192726029,Break off the stylus at the predetermined breaking points. Use a pliers.
images/PXL_20201204_193939978,Solder all resistors.;Pay attention to the correct value which is printed on the board.
images/PXL_20201204_194415170,Solder the potentiometer.;Solder the capacitor.;Solder the LED. Pay attention to the correct orientation (See Step 1)!
images/PXL_20201204_194610956,Solder the PNP transistor BC557C (Q4). Attention: Risk of mix-up with the NPN transistors.
images/PXL_20201204_194852017,Solder the three NPN transistors BC547C (Q1--Q3).
images/PXL_20201204_195312026,Turn around the board.;Bend the soldering tabs and solder the button to the board. The direction does not matter.
images/PXL_20201204_195506414,Solder on the speaker.
images/PXL_20201204_195759617,Thread the red and black wire of the battery holder through the holes (not in the picture) above the solder pads and insert the wires into the solder pads. Attention: red is positive{,} black is negative;Solder the wires.
images/PXL_20201204_200426013,Solder a stiff wire (for example a long cut-off leg of a resistor) at the tip of the stylus in the soldering point;Then bend the wire over the tip and solder it on the long soldering points (back and front) at the tip.; It is not im portant to cover from hole to hole but the wire should bend over the edge.
images/PXL_20201204_200521315,Thread the flexible wire through the hole at the back-poart of the stylus (not in picture);Solder the wire then to the soldering pint;Thread the other end trough the hole near the connector point on the board.; Solder the wire to the soldering point.
images/PXL_20201204_200656995,Insert a battery and turn on your organ.;The green LED should turn on now.;You are done. Have fun playing your organ!
