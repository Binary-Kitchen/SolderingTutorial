images/PXL_20230226_094917231,Check your components.;Tip: The resistor value can be determined by colour coding.; Orientation of resistors does not matter.;LEDs have a flat side and a shorter leg. Both indicate the negative side.
images/PXL_20230226_101028627,LEDs have a direction. The long leg is the anode (+). On the PCB{,} the anode is marked by a round solder pad; insert all LEDs from the PCB front (in the middle you can read NE555D) into the holes marked with a circle. Attention: The long leg belongs into the hole with the round pad!
images/PXL_20230226_101632875,Take a business card or a piece of cardboard and hold the LEDs with it. Turn the board upside down and place the board on the LED heads.;Now solder only one leg of each LED.
images/PXL_20230226_101921317,Correct any misaligned LEDs.;You can warm up the soldering point again and use your finger to correct the position of the LEDs.
images/PXL_20230226_102940131,Now solder the remaining legs of each LED and cut off the excess wire.;Make sure{,} that you cut off the excess wire relatively close to the PCB.
images/PXL_20230226_103114580,Push the NE555 through the board from the front. Attention! The NE555 has a orientation{,} which is marked by a nose on one side. The nose is also printed on the board.;Now solder all the legs of the NE555 to the back.;Tip: You can solder only one leg and correct the position afterwards.;Cut off the excess wires very close to the PCB.
images/PXL_20230226_104524902,Now solder the resistors R1 (\usePart{R1}){,} R2 (\usePart{R2}) and R3 (\usePart{R3}). The resistors have different resistance values marked by coloured rings. Make sure{,} that you solder the right resistor to the right place; cut off the excess wires.
images/PXL_20230226_104851340,Now solder the diodes D1 and D2;Diodes have a direction which is marked with a line. Make sure{,} that the line on the diode matches the line on the board.
images/PXL_20230226_105857930,Capacitors have different values. These can be seen on the PCB and with a number code on the capacitors. The orientation of the capacitors does not matter.;Now solder on the capacitors C1 (10nF{,} 103){,} C2 (1uF{,} 105){,} C3 (100nF{,} 104) and C4 (100nF{,} 104);Cut off excess wires.
images/PXL_20230226_110642128,Now solder the two CD4017; Again{,} make sure that the noses on the chip match the noses on the board (sometimes the noses on the board are hard to see. They are both near R1).
images/PXL_20230226_111342528,Now solder the switch SW2; The switch has no direction. This time the switch is soldered on and not put through the PCB.;Bend the solder tags a little bit downwards{,} so that the solder tags reach the PCB.; You may have to bend the solder tags a little bit crooked{,} so that the switch lies cleanly (there is not much space).
images/PXL_20230226_111346680,Solder switch SW1. This one has no direction; Tip: Solder only one leg at first. This way you can correct the position as usual.
images/PXL_20230226_111544235,Now solder the potentiometer RV1; Tip: Solder only one leg at first. This way you can correct the position as usual.
images/PXL_20230226_112048911,Finally solder on the battery holder. This again has one direction. The outlines are printed on the board. Make sure{,} that the outline matches the battery holder; Tip: First solder only one leg. This way you can correct the position as usual; then insert a CR2032 battery.
images/thumbnail,You are done!;With the push button you can switch on your heart.;With the slide switch you can switch between running light and permanent light.;With a screwdriver you can adjust the speed of the running light (Attention: At the maximum setting the running light does not work anymore. Stay a little below that).
