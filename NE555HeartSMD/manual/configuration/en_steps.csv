images/PXL_20230110_194455638,Fix the board to the base with adhesive tape.; Take up U1 with an adhesive tape. The tape should only cover half of the IC.;Then the IC can be aligned and fixed with tape.;Alignment is important: The notch on the IC must match the notch on the board.;Now solder all the legs of the IC.;Then remove the tape and fix the other side.;Then solder U2 and U3 on.,
images/PXL_20230110_200033954,Solder the resistors R2 to R4.;First tin only one pad of a resistor on the PCB.;Pick up the resistor with tweezers and heat the solder on the pad again.;Then insert the resistor sideways into the hot pad{,} until the resistor is in the right position.;Then solder the second side.,
images/PXL_20230110_200345448,Solder the capacitors C1-C4 onto the pad using the same technique as before; Note that the packages are colour coded. The capacitors have no printed numbering.,
images/PXL_20230110_200345448,Solder the diodes D1 and D2 with the same technique. Attention: Diodes have one direction. The diode is marked with a line. This line is also printed on the board (left). Then solder the potentiometer RV1 onto the board.,
images/PXL_20230110_200732716,Now solder the switch SW2.,
images/PXL_20230110_200819130,Now the battery holder comes on the board. Attention{,} this one has one direction again. This direction is marked with a cut edge on the component as well as on the board.,
images/PXL_20230110_200908424,Finally{,} only the black switch is soldered on the back. To do this{,} first bend down the solder flags.;Then solder the solder flags onto the board;The back of the board is now finished.,
images/PXL_20230110_205045037,Attention! The alignment of the LEDs is important! First read all steps.;LEDs are soldered on using the same technique as the resistors.;To do this{,} turn the board over.;The LEDs have a small green line on one edge on the top.;There are small arrows or small dots printed on the board. The arrows or dots on the board indicate the side to which the small green line must be placed.;Tip: If the arrows or dots on the board are difficult to see{,} refer to the layout drawing on the last page of the instructions,\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../../misc/led_drawing/smd_led_up.pdf}
images/PXL_20230110_205203890,Now only the battery has to be inserted; A metal collector (in the picture on the right) has to grip on top of the battery!; Switch on. Ready!; The switch SW2 can be used to switch between permanent lights and chaser LEDs;The potentiometer influences the speed of the LEDs.,
