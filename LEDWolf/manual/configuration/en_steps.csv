images/LED-Wolf_20241120_124701689-EDIT,This step is optional: Take some fine sandpaper and sand off the burnt laser traces.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_124855746-EDIT,Take the wooden head with \SI{1.6}{\mm} with the wolf's eyes and the \SI{3}{\mm} piece of wood with two round holes;Glue both together. Make sure that both pieces of wood are nicely centered on top of each other.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_125156874-EDIT,Now take the small wooden rings (eye rings) and the two LEDs. Attention: LEDs also have a direction. The longer leg of the LEDs marks the positive side;Place the eye rings on the LEDs. Then insert the LEDs into the round holes of the parts you have just glued.;Turn the LEDs so{,} that the short (negative) legs point diagonally towards the opposite ear.;Bend the short (negative) legs all the way down onto the wood. The legs should now cross each other;Shorten the short legs so that they are no longer touching.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_125902944-EDIT,Now stick the piece of wood with the large hole in the middle onto the protruding{,} long (positive) legs{,} so that the legs fit through the small holes (the ones towards the snout);Glue the piece of wood in place.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_130217783-EDIT,Now take a piece of wire{,} which you cut off earlier and bend it into a 'U'.;Insert the bent 'U' into the uppermost small holes.;Glue the wire{,} so that it can no longer slip out of the holes.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_130531254-EDIT,Now screw the bar into one of the side holes using the wood screw.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_130700072-EDIT,Insert a battery. The plus symbol on the battery should point upwards.;Bend the long (positive) legs downwards and fix everything with the beam.;Screw the second screw into the hole in the beam and the remaining hole on the side.
images/LED-Wolf_20241120_130739962-EDIT,Make sure{,} that the glue of the 'U'-shaped wire is already completely dry.;Then bend the wire upwards{,} so that you have a loop to hang it on a string...;
images/thumbnail,You're done! You can now thread a string through the loop and hang the wolf on your neck.
