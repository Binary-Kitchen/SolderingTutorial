# LED Wolf

This great LED wolf is a good way to start tinkering if you don't have a soldering iron with you at the moment. All you need is a little glue and a small Phillips screwdriver to assemble this great wolf. Then the wolf lights up with its great yellow eyes! The CR2032 battery is securely screwed together with a bar.
