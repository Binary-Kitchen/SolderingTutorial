images/1_Parts_Overview, Time to check your parts! Look at the parts list on page 1 and make sure you have everything.; You should find: main PCB{,} resistors{,} capacitors{,} diode{,} ATtiny85 chip{,} microphone{,} buzzer{,} button{,} LEDs{,} and battery pack.; Also find the 5 tree PCBs: 2 trunk parts{,} plus rings for 5{,} 4{,} and 3 LEDs.; Pro tip: Sort everything into groups - it makes building much easier!
images/2_Base_Solderbridge, Start with the base PCB - we need to add a solder bridge first! This will put your board into the correct working mode.; Use your soldering iron to connect the upper two pads marked in the picture.; Take your time and make sure the solder flows nicely between the upper pads and not the lower one.
images/3_Base_Resistors, Now let's add the resistors - the easy parts that don't care which way they go!; Find the resistors by their color bands and put them in the right spots.; Push them through{,} bend the legs on the back so that they hold by themselves{,} solder them{,} and snip off the extra.;
images/4_Base_FandD, Now the Capacitors (C1 and C2 - they don't have a direction) and the diode (D1) - this one's tricky because it has a direction!; IMPORTANT: The stripe on the diode must match the stripe on the PCB! In the lower section of the picture the stripe is on the right side.; If you get this backwards{,} the blowing mechanism won't work.;
images/4_1_MicNµController, Next up is the microphone and the ATtiny85 chip.; Solder the microphone to the marked location.; The microcontroller chip only goes in one way - look for the little notch or dot.; Line up that notch with the marking on the PCB and push it in gently.;
images/5_Button_Buzzer_Prep_Combined, Get the button and buzzer ready!; For the button{,} bend its legs flat first so that they lie flat against the PCB.; The buzzer has two wires - black for GND (square pad) and red for VCC (round pad).; Pre-tin the PCB pads to make soldering easier.; After that use the adhesive to stick the buzzer in place.
images/8_0_Stem_Parts_Combined, Here are your two trunk parts - let's build the tree backbone!; Notice the connection pads on each piece.; The big GND pads need to be next to each other when you put them together.; Slide the two trunk parts together; Don't solder them yet - the bottom ring needs to be placed first;
images/8_2_Stem_Slotted, Now push the combined trunk into the base PCB - it only fits one way!; The trunk should stand up straight and tall.; Look for the pads that are at 90-degree angles - those are what we'll solder.; Make sure the trunk is pushed all the way down before soldering.
images/8_3_Stem_Soldedered, Solder those angled pads to connect the trunk firmly to the base!; Add enough solder to make strong connections.; Your tree should now stand up on its own.; Turn the board over and solder the bottom pads of the trunk; REMEMBER: Still don't solder those big GND pads at the side of the trunk - the 5-LED-ring comes first!
images/10_0_Ring5_Prep, Now we build the tree layers! Start with the biggest ring (5 LED holes).; This ring needs to slide over the top of the trunk.; Check the orientation - the connection pads on the ring should line up with the trunk pads.; Slide it down until it sits on the edge.
images/10_1_Ring5_Soldered, Solder the ring to the trunk pads - you're making the bottom layer of your tree!; Make sure the solder connects both the ring and trunk nicely.; Now for the important step we've been waiting for - solder those big GND pads on the trunk!; This connects the two trunk pieces electrically and makes everything work.
images/11_1_Ring4_Soldered, Time for the middle ring (4 LED holes)!; Same process - check the orientation and line up those pads.; Slide it down the trunk until it sits on the edge.; This creates the middle section of your Christmas tree.
images/12_Ring3_Soldered, Last ring! The small 3-LED ring goes on top.; This one has arrows to show you which way it goes - match them up!; Solder it in place and your tree frame is complete!; Now we just need to add all the lights.
images/13_0_LED_Setup, LED Preparation - LEDs only work one way so watch the polarity.; Remember: round pad = positive (+){,} square pad = negative (-).; Get this wrong and the whole ring will not light up.; Cut the LED legs with your side-cutters leaving about 6 mm of leg.; The negative (GND) leg is the one with the bigger metal piece inside the LED, and the LED body also has a flat edge on that side.
images/13_1_LED_PreBend, Let's add LEDs - here's the trick - we're going to bend them like little hooks.; This makes them hold themselves in place while soldering!; Start by inserting the legs a little bit into the PCB.; Now bend the LED down until the LEDs are facing down like tree branches (push it in more if needed).
images/13_3LED_Green_Soldered_smaller, Solder all the green LEDs using this hook method.; Start from the bottom ring and work your way up.; Double-check the polarity on each one - square pad is negative!; Solder each LED from the top{,} making sure the solder flows through to the pad.
images/14_0_LED_Orange_Prep, The grand finale - the orange star LED on top!; This one is special - it goes in a specific direction.; REALLY IMPORTANT: negative leg toward microphone side{,} positive toward button side.; Get this right and your star will shine!
images/14_1_LED_Orange_Soldered, Your orange star is in place - looking good!; All the LEDs are done{,} your tree is almost ready to light up.; Just need power now!; Time for the battery pack.
images/16_0_BAT_Pack_Soldered, Battery pack time!; Insert the pins through from underneath so the pack sits below the board.; Get it positioned right before soldering.; Solder those battery pack pins with plenty of heat - maybe adjust your soldering iron for this.; WARNING: Do NOT use normal side-cutters on these thick pins - they'll break your tool! :-) ; 
images/16_1_BAT_Pack_Knips, Use heavy-duty cutters for steel wires to trim those thick pins!; Trust me - normal electronics side-cutters WILL break on these.; Cut them as short as you can without damaging the solder joints.; Safety first - wear eye protection when cutting!
images/17_Finished, The moment of truth! Pop in two AAA batteries.; Your tree should start flickering like a real candle.; Blow hard on the microphone to hear your tree's first song!; Congratulations - you built a BlinkyTree!
