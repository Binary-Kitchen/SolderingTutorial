You can buy them online or in larger electronics shops;Rechargeable batteries are excellent and good for the environment.;Tip: When soldering the components{,} solder only one leg at a time. Then you can warm up the soldered joint again and correct the position.;Attention: All parts on the grass PCB are soldered{,} from the side from which the golden blades of grass can be seen.;Caution: Always wear protective goggles. If you cut wires{,}they can fly around uncontrolled.
images/PXL_20230311_185359302,First solder resistors R1-R3;Resistors have no direction and the values of R1-R3 are identical. It doesn't matter at which position you solder them;Cut off the excess wires.
images/PXL_20230311_194654318,Solder the switch SW1. You have to bend the solder flags downwards{,} so that the solder flags touch the PCB.;First apply solder to one pad only{,} put the solder aside. Then heat the spot again and slide the switch onto it from the side.

images/PXL_20230311_200041041,Solder the switches SW2-SW4.; The tip{,} to solder only one leg is very helpful here.; Then cut off the excess wire legs.
images/PXL_20230311_200514221,Solder the potentiometers RV1-RV3.;Attention: Take special care{,} that you insert the components from the right side.;Cut off the excess wires.
images/PXL_20230311_200958418,Now take the flower and solder on the RGB-LED.; One pin is longer than all the others. This one has to go into the hole with the rectangular solder pad (not rounded corners).;Make sure{,} that there are no solder bridges{,} don't use too much solder.
images/PXL_20230311_201141329,Solder the straight pin headers to the flower;Put the short side through the flower from the back and solder the legs from the front;
images/PXL_20230311_201348140,Solder the flower stem to the long side of the pin header from the back;; Again{,} make sure{,} that the labelling of the flower and also the labelling of the flower stem is on the back.
images/PXL_20230311_201141329,Solder the straight pin headers to the flower; Push the short side through the flower from the back and solder the legs from the front.;
images/PXL_20230311_201739716,Solder the L-shaped pin header onto the flower stem. Put the pin header through the stem from the back and solder it from the front side.;Again{,} make sure{,} that the pin header is not soldered crooked.
images/PXL_20230311_202301752,Solder the flower stem onto the free holes on the grass board. The large potentiometers should be in front of the stem (see photo).
images/PXL_20230311_202533988,Shorten the cables of the battery holder to about 5cm.; Take a small piece of insulation off the wire ends and put some solder on it.
images/PXL_20230311_202947978,Put the wires from the bottom into the holes at the solder pads marked BT1 and (+); make sure{,} that the red wire is soldered at the place with the (+); solder both wires.;Glue the motherboard to the battery holder with hot glue.;Put the caps on the potentiometers.
images/PXL_20230311_204436877,You are done! With the push button on the back you can switch on your flower.;With the big potentiometers you can set the colours blue{,} red and green. The small switches by the potentiometers can turn the colours completely on or off.;The small blue potentiometer on the back adjusts the overall brightness. Caution: If you turn it up too much{,} individual colours will be switched off.
