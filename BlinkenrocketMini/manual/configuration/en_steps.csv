Look carefully here;Tip: These are almost exclusively THT (through-hole) components. You push the components through the board from the top and solder them on from the other side. You can bend the legs slightly when inserting them through the back of the board{,} so that the parts hold and can be soldered more easily.

If the rocket is lying in front of you with the tip pointing away from you{,} you must insert the LED matrix so that the label is on the right. Make sure that it lies flat on the board.

Insert the battery holder into the board{,} so that the outline drawn and the outline of the battery holder match.;Turn the board onto the top rivet and solder the battery holder from the top.;The pins are very close to the matrix. Be careful not to melt any plastic parts with the soldering iron.
