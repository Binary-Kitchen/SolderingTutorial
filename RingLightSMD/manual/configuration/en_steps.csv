images/IMG_20211022_190914, Start with the resistors; Resistors have no direction; Solder on resistors R1-R20. For this{,} tin a pad;Then heat up tin and feed the resistor to the side with tweezers;Then solder the second side,
images/IMG_20211022_190914, Be Careful! Alignment of the LEDs is important! First read all the points of this step;Solder the LEDs in the same way as the resistors;The LEDs have a small green line on the top; There are small arrows or dots printed on the board; The arrows or dots on the board show the side{,} where the small green line has to be,\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../../misc/led_drawing/smd_led_up.pdf}

Tape should only cover half of the IC;Then the IC can be aligned and fixed with tape;Alignment important: Small dot on IC must match dot on PCB top left;Solder all legs on PCB;Then tape can be removed and the other side can be fixed,

images/IMG_20211022_194460,Insert the battery as shown; the pick-ups on the positive side must touch the top of the battery. Slide the battery into the battery holder from the left and press only the left side down.
images/IMG_20211022_194455, Now press the battery in place and you're done :)
