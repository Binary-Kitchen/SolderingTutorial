images/PXL_20230401_130137078,Prepare the black outer parts as shown in the photo; The outer part with a sealing lip is in the picture at the top. The outer part with groove is in the picture at the bottom.;Insert the inner part with the cable containment (long compartment with two bars at each end) into the black outer part with groove.;Insert the inner part with the rectangular compartments into the black outer part with sealing lip.;Make sure{,} that the inner parts are fully recessed. 
images/PXL_20230401_130326881,Put the two hinges into each other and make sure{,} that they fit together neatly. Now screw an M3x20 screw from the outside through the hole of each hinge. The hinge should still be able to move.;At the beginning the hinge can be a bit tight{,} but this will get better with time.
images/PXL_20230401_130727878,Now screw two M3x20 screws through the two lower lugs (through the outer part with groove). Again{,} do not screw too tight. Now thread the clips as shown with two M3x20 screws and screw them tight. Do not use too much force. The tabs should move easily.
images/PXL_20230401_131123236,Put the bearing into the soldering iron holder. Now clamp the bearing with a screw and nut (the nut goes into the 6-sided hole). Tip: If the soldering iron holder in the case is not tight enough{,} you can put some tape around the place with the holders to increase the diameter. (See the example in the next picture)

images/PXL_20230403_091315079,Put the two coil parts together{,} so that the nipples are on the outside;Fix the two parts with some super glue. Apply it inside and outside. Do not use too much; let the superglue dry well. White spots can usually be wiped off afterwards.

images/PXL_20230319_110506982,You are done! Have fun with your soldering iron case; You can put the soldering iron into the soldering iron holder as shown.
images/united,Tip: When inserting the soldering iron{,} make sure{,} that it is fully inserted into the holder. Otherwise too much heat will be transferred to the bearing and then the holder. This could deform the holder.;Tip: If you use a thumb-screw{,} the soldering iron must be at the very edge so that it fits into the housing. Pay attention to this when closing it for the first time. Otherwise the soldering iron could break. If the case can be closed without force{,} everything is fine.
