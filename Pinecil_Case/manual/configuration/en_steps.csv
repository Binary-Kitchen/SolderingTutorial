images/PXL_20250206_144538592-EDIT,Prepare the black outer parts as shown in the photo; the outer part with the sealing lip is at the bottom of the picture. The outer part with groove is shown at the top.;Insert the inner part with the cable containment (long compartment with two bars at each end) into the black outer part with sealing lip.;Insert the inner part with the rectangular compartments into the black outer part with groove.;Make sure that the inner parts are fully recessed. 
images/PXL_20250206_144614834,Insert the two hinges into each other and make sure that they fit together properly. Now screw an M3x20 screw through the hole in each hinge from the outside; do not screw the screws too tightly. The hinge should still be able to move; at the beginning,the hinge may still be a little tight{,} but this will improve with time.
images/PXL_20250206_144835103,Now screw two M3x20 screws through the two lower tabs (through the outer part with groove). Again{,} do not screw too tightly. The tabs should not bend;Now insert the clips with two M3x20 screws as shown and screw them tight. Do not use too much force. The tabs should be easy to move.
images/PXL_20250206_144922575,Insert the bearing into the soldering iron holder. Now clamp the bearing in place with a screw and nut (the nut goes into the hexagonal hole). Do not use too much force!
images/PXL_20250206_145049189,Put two of the coil parts together. This should work with a little force.;Fix the two parts with a little thin superglue.
images/PXL_20250206_145549402,Glue the largest magnet into the recess provided in the upper part of the inlay.;The orientation (north/south) of the magnet does not matter in this case.;Tip: It is better to use less glue than too much.
images/PXL_20250206_150034596,Attention: In the next steps{,} it is important how the magnets are aligned.;Take all the magnets and carefully bring them together{,} so that the magnets attract and align themselves.;Now take one magnet at a time and always mark the same side with a felt-tip pen. This is very important later on!;Tip: You can use a screwdriver or a metal surface to better organize the magnets (see picture).
images/PXL_20250206_150448682,Tip: It is better to use too little superglue for this step than too much.;Glue six of eight 4x2mm neodymium magnets into the recesses provided in the inlay.;Important: Make sure the marking is visible on all magnets!
images/PXL_20250206_150640581,Tip: It is better to use too little superglue for this step than too much;Glue the remaining two 4x2mm neodymium magnets into the coils{,} so that the marking is NOT visible.
images/PXL_20250206_150829881,Tip: It is better to use too little superglue for this step than too much;Glue the four 5x1mm neodymium magnets into the brass wool cover{,} so that the marking is NOT visible.
images/PXL_20250206_154815176,Press the brass wool into your case. It should lie flat and sit well / not fall out.;Tip: You may have to cut your brass wool in half again. You can do this with wire cutters or tin snips. Save the rest as a spare. Once everything is dry{,}you can add soldering iron holders{,} the coils and the brass wool cover. All the magnets should tighten.
images/PXL_20250206_155223632,You're done! Have fun with your soldering iron case; You can insert the soldering iron into the soldering iron holder as shown.
images/united,Tip: When inserting the soldering iron{,} make sure that it is fully inserted into the holder. Otherwise too much heat will be transferred to the bearing and then the holder. Tip: If you are using a thumb screw{,} the soldering iron must be right at the edge so that it fits into the housing. Pay attention to this when closing for the first time. Otherwise the soldering iron could break. If the case can be closed without force{,} everything is fine.
