images/PXL_20241002_125601314, Turn the PCB over; you will find the LED pad D1 on the trunk. One of the pads is longer and marked with a plus sign (+). Add solder to the longer LED pad marked with a plus sign (+).
images/PXL_20241002_125648828-EDIT,The long leg of the LED marks the positive side. Solder the positive leg (the long one) to the plus pad{,} to which you have already applied solder.;Make sure{,} that the second leg also touches the other pad without solder.
images/PXL_20241002_125719243,Solder the other leg of the LED (cathode{,} negative side) to the circuit board.
images/PXL_20241002_125840114-EDIT,The button has no direction.;Put solder on one of the pads of the button.;Bend the legs of the button so{,} that the legs can touch the surface of the board.;Heat the pad with solder again push one leg of the button from the side onto the pad.;Make sure{,} that the other leg of the button touches the other pad.
images/PXL_20241002_125905007-EDIT,Solder the other leg of the button to the board.

images/PXL_20241002_130013051-EDIT,The battery holder has a direction{,} which is marked with a beveled edge. The same beveled edge is also printed on the circuit board.;Put solder on one pad of the battery holder;Heat the pad with solder again and push the battery holder onto the pad from the side.;Make sure that the other leg of the battery holder touches the other pad.;Solder the other leg onto the other pad on the circuit board.
images/PXL_20241002_130041874-EDIT,Add some solder to the round circle. It is sufficient if one side is covered with solder.
images/PXL_20241002_130114825-EDIT,Attention: Always use pliers or tweezers for this step. The nail will be very hot; pick up the nail with tweezers/tongs and solder it to the round circle; you can then add more solder to the areas that are still golden and solder the nail all around.
images/PXL_20241002_130212123-EDIT,Insert the battery as shown; the terminals on the positive side must touch the top of the battery. Slide the battery into the battery holder from the left and press only the left side down.
