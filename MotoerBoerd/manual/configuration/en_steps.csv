images/Motoerboerd_Uebersicht_alle_Bauteile,Check your components;Don't throw away the instructions. We will need them later!;The board has a front and a back. MotörBörd and CD4069 are printed on the front.
images/PXL_20250624_160351243,First solder on the resistors R1 and R2.;Resistors have no direction.;R1 and R2 have the color code: \usePart{R1}.;Insert the resistors through the holes from the front and solder them on from the back.;Now solder in the diode. Attention! The diode has one direction: there is a black line on the diode. The same line is also printed on the circuit board. Both lines must be on the same side.;Cut off the protruding wires.
images/PXL_20250624_160525954,Solder on the ceramic capacitors (labeled 331).;The ceramic capacitor also has no direction.;Cut off the excess wires.
images/PXL_20250624_160649098,Now take the CD4069 chip. The chip has a small notch on one short side. This notch is also printed on the circuit board. This shows you the correct direction; insert the chip correctly from the front and solder all the legs from the back. Make sure that you do not accidentally connect any legs with solder (solder bridges).
images/Motoerboerd_geloetete_Unterseite,Now take the large electrolytic capacitor. Attention! This has one direction!;The short leg of the electrolytic capacitor is minus (-). The minus (-) is also printed on the circuit board. Insert the capacitor so that the short leg ends up in the hole with the minus. Solder the electrolytic capacitor from the back and cut off the protruding legs.
images/Motoerboerd_geloeteter_Lautsprecher,Now turn the circuit board onto its back and place it in front of you so that the two notches are facing you. Cut the wires of the speaker to about 3cm.;Take about 2-3mm of the insulation off each end of the remaining wire and tin the wire.;Now solder the wires to the circuit board; the red one on the left and the black one on the right.;Glue the speaker with the opening facing upwards in the middle of the back of the circuit board. But leave space for the motor (see next step).
images/PXL_20250726_145415766,Turn the circuit board back to the front;Insert the motor into the notches in the circuit board. The white sticker on the motor should be facing you;Take something to put on the board so that it is slightly higher. The circuit board should be positioned exactly in the middle of the motor.;Solder everything in place.;Stick the motor sticker over the white sticker on the motor.
images/Motoerboerd_feritg_geloetet_von_unten,Take the printed instructions and paint the bird with your favorite colors. Cut out the outline of the bird and stick it to the motor as shown in the picture.
images/thumbnail,You're done!; If you now turn the motor quickly{,} it will act as a generator and your bird will chirp!;You have to turn clockwise.
