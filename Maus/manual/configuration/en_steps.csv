images/PXL_20250915_082145220-EDIT, Check all components and use the list on the first page and the image to make sure everything is complete.;Tip: You can identify resistance values using the color code on the resistors. You can also use a multimeter to measure the resistors.
images/PXL_20250915_093810805-EDIT,We will start with resistors R1 and R2 (\usePart{R1|R2}){,} R3 and R4 (\usePart{R3|R4}) and R5 and R6 (\usePart{R5|R6}).; Solder these onto the back of the circuit board. The number and value of each resistor is printed on the circuit board. It is important that you solder the correct resistor in the correct place{,} otherwise it will not work afterwards.;It does not matter which way round the resistors are soldered on.;First apply solder to one of the two pads and then slide the resistor onto it from the side until it is properly positioned. The other wire should reach the second pad.;Then solder the other leg on.;Cut off the excess legs. Be careful not to scratch the circuit board.
images/PXL_20250915_094913875-EDIT,Now take both BC547 transistors in your hand.;Caution: These have a direction. You can tell which way is which by the flattened side of the black part. The outline is also printed on the circuit board.;Bend the legs into a star shape so that the middle leg points away from the flattened side.;Bend the two outer legs diagonally toward the flattened side (you can correct this later).;Solder Q1 and Q2 onto the circuit board. The flat side should point towards the head of the mouse.;Cut off the excess wire.
images/PXL_20250915_095523534-EDIT,In this step{,} you will solder the red and green LEDs.;Attention: LEDs have a specific installation direction. You can tell which way round they go by the length of the legs. The longer leg is the positive side (plus side). The + symbol is also marked on the circuit board{,} and the plus pad is slightly longer on the circuit board.;Solder the green LED to D1 and the red LED to D2.;Cut off the excess wire.
images/PXL_20250915_100036383-EDIT,We have two buttons. One has four legs and the other has two. Take the one with four legs and solder it to SW2. The direction of the button does not matter.
images/PXL_20250915_100155831-EDIT,Caution: When performing this step{,} do not leave the soldering iron on the solder tabs of the button for too long. It is somewhat sensitive to heat.; The switch (two pins/legs) has no direction.;Apply some solder to one of the pads on switch SW1.;Bend the legs of the switch so that they can touch the surface of the circuit board.;Heat the pad with solder again and push one leg of the switch onto the pad from the side.;Make sure that the other leg of the switch touches the other pad.;Now solder the other side in place.
images/PXL_20250915_101209212-EDIT,Take the rigid wire and cut off \SI{10}{\cm}.;Remove \SI{2}{\cm} of insulation on one side and \SI{0.5}{\cm} on the other side {so that} the bare copper wire is visible.;Bend the wire on the \SI{2}{\cm} side to form a small open hook.;Now take the flexible wire and remove \SI{0.5}{\cm} of insulation from each side.;Solder one side of the flexible wire to the short side of the rigid wire and the other side to J2.;Tip: It is easier if you tin the wire ends beforehand.
images/PXL_20250915_105527747-EDIT,Now take the long piece of rigid wire and remove the insulation completely.;Bend your hot wire into the shape you want.;You can add breaks (using a short piece of insulation or tape). You can build loops and also go backwards or forwards. Let your imagination run wild!;Tip: Use round objects such as screwdrivers or pens{,} to bend the wire into a nice round shape.;Then tin the two ends of the rigid wire and solder them to the circuit board at J1 and J3.; Caution: Use pliers or a third hand{,} as the wire gets very hot!
images/PXL_20250915_105800219-EDIT,Now solder the battery holder to BT1. The red cable to + and the black cable to -.;Optional: You can shorten the cable by 6 cm if you wish.
images/PXL_20250915_110257348-EDIT,You can now paint the mouse. It usually has brown arms{,} legs{,} ears{,} and black eyes. But there are no limits to your imagination.;How about a tattoo or sunglasses?
images/thumbnail,Now glue the circuit board to the battery holder with hot glue so that it serves as a stand.;Try your luck and see if you can complete your hot wire!;If it's too difficult{,} you can make the hook a little bigger or make your course easier.
