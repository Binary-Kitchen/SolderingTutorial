images/IMG_8984, Hints:;Resistor size can be determined by color coding;Alignment of the PCB in such a way{,} that LED designation can be read normally (see picture);Alignment with resistors does not matter;LEDs have a flat side and a shorter leg. Both indicate the negative side;The orientation of capacitors doesn't matter{,} because ceramic capacitors are used
images/IMG_8986,Soldering the pin header JP1
images/IMG_8987,Solder resistors R1 - R4 and R6 (\SI{220}{\ohm});The orientation doesn't matter
images/IMG_8988,Solder resistors R5 (\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm});orientation does not matter
images/IMG_8989,Solder resistor R7 (\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm});orientation does not matter
images/IMG_8990,Solder crystal Q1;orientation doesn't matter
images/IMG_8991,Solder capacitors C1 and C2 (104);orientation doesn't matter
images/IMG_8992, Solder capacitors C3 and C4 (22);orientation doesn't matter
images/IMG_8994,Solder IC1 socket as well as IC2 socket with the nose to the right onto the PCB
images/IMG_8995,Solder switches S1 to S4 as well as MODE{,} START and REPEAT; Hint: Legs have different distances. Nothing has to be bent. Switch fits exactly
images/IMG_8996,solder 7-segment display LED7;The dot must be in the lower right corner
images/IMG_8997,Solder loudspeaker SG1;Attention! Alignment is important;The printed plus sign must be in line with the PCB;Remove the protective sticker if present
images/IMG_8999,Solder LED1 to LED4. Note colors according to picture;Attention! Alignment is important;LEDs have a longer and a shorter leg. The shorter leg indicates the negative side;On the PCB the negative side is represented by a flat area on the circle of the LED.
images/IMG_9000,Solder POWER connector with the opening downwards
images/IMG_9004,Insert IC1 and IC2 with the nose to the right into the socket;Tip: The legs of the ICs must be bent slightly{,} to fit into the socket;Possibly remove and tin the insulation at the tips of the connecting cables of the battery;Screw on the battery (+ red{,} - black)
images/IMG_9006,Fix the battery compartment with double-sided tape to the backside of the board;Cover the two ICs with some tape (protection against touch and moisture while playing);Insert the batteries;Done!
