images/03_en, This is the complete curcuit.
images/04_en, Remove a short stretch of insulation from the end of all wires.
images/05, Tin-coat the contacts of the switch.; Solder a wire to one of these contacts.
images/06, Solder one of the motor's wires to the other side of the switch.
images/07, Extend the other motor wire with the second spare wire.
images/08, Bend the pins of the battery holder inwards; Clamp the wires under the contacts.
images/09, Solder the pins to the wires{,} so a curcuit is created.
images/10, Turn over the battery holder and insert the battery with + upwards; Test it!
images/11, Now we come to the creative part!; Combine the circuit with light decorative materials.; Use hot glue to attach things.; When using glue{,} pay attention to keep it off the rotor with the weight. Also{,} loose things that could get entangled{,} shouldn’t be too close the the motor.; Install the battery holder easily accessible so you can change the battery.; Be careful that metallic things don’t cause a short-curcuit. If necessary{,} use some hot glue as insulation.
