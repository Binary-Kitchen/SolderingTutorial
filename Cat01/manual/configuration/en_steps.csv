First read all steps;The LEDs have a small green line on the top; On the PCB there are small arrows or small dots printed on; The arrows or dots on the PCB show the side{,} where the small green line has to go;Tip: When the cat is looking at you{,} the dots are on the left side. ;To solder the LED{,} heat the solder again and move the LED from the side onto the pad with solder;Then solder the other side;,\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../../misc/led_drawing/smd_led_up_mirrored.pdf}

images/PXL_20210221_112137301, The battery holder has a direction{,} which is marked with a cut edge. The same edge is also printed on the PCB.;Put solder on one pad of the battery holder;Heat the pad with solder again and slide the battery holder from the side onto the pad.;Make sure{,} that the other leg of the battery holder touches the other pad.;Solder the other leg onto the other pad on the PCB.
images/PXL_20210221_112212478,Insert the battery as shown; the taps on the positive side must touch the top of the battery.; Slide the battery into the battery holder from the left and press down on the left side only.
