images/IMG_20180630_225522,Hint: Resistors (white package) have printed numbers on it and can be found in the overview (direction does not matter); Capacitors are marked with colours (direction does not matter); LEDs are in the black packes (DIRECTION IMPORTANT) 
images/IMG_20180630_232055,Carefull: Check printed numbers on the resistors with the overview; Solder Resistors R1 - R19 to the board front and back; Direction of the resistors not important; R9{,} R13 and R18 are not needed
images/IMG_20180630_234207,Solder capacitor C1 - C3 on the board; Begin with capacitor C2;Direction of the capacitor is not important
images/IMG_20180630_235003,Carefull: LEDs do have a direction! First read this part completely;Solder LED 1 - 7 to the board; LED2 is the green LED (single black package); The LED has a green marking on top; A dot or a arrow is printed onto the board; The dot/arrow shows the direction where the green marking has to be directed while soldering; Hint: If you can not identify the arror or dot on the board look at the drawing at the end of this manual,\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../../misc/led_drawing/smd_led_up.pdf}
images/IMG_20180630_235504,Solder fuse F1 - F4 to the board; Direction of the fuse is not important
images/IMG_20180630_235606,Carefull: Direction important! Solder TPS2513 (6 pins) to the board; A vertical line (very fine!) is printed on the board and the chip. Both lines are marking the direction and need to match
images/IMG_20180630_235823,Solder LM-317 to the board; Hint: Bend the legs befor soldering
images/IMG_20180701_000355,Solder USB connector X1 and X2 to the board; Hint: It is possible that some holder-noses needs to be clipped
images/IMG_20180701_001109,Solder the pin header JP1 - JP6 with the short side to the board; JP7 is optional and is only needed if you want a V-Meter
images/IMG_20180701_001733,Solder switch SW1 to the board; Direction not important
images/IMG_20180701_001909,Solder potentiometer VR1 to the board
images/IMG_20180701_002328,Solder ATX connector J1 to the board
images/IMG_20180701_002328,Screw black and red binding posts to the board;
images/IMG_20180701_002328,Optional: If you have nylon legs{,} push them into the holes in the corner; Optional: To prevent shortages put some hot glue on the back of the ATX connectors; Hint: The pin-filed on the top left corner is for development and will not be soldered;
