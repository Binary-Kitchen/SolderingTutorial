Your LED spacer should now be about 10mm long. Insert an LED through the small holes; insert the LED (long leg is the positive leg) through the holes LED1 Bottom. The long leg belongs through the hole{,} which is marked with a plus sign.;Solder the LED from the other side.;Tip: First solder only one leg{,} so you can correct the position again by reheating.;Then cut off the protruding pieces of wire very close to the surface.
images/PXL_20250306_125947422,Insert the LED2 top and LED3 top and solder them in place. Again{,} make sure to insert the long leg through the hole with the plus;Solder the LEDs in place and cut off the excess wires.
images/PXL_20250306_130519707-EDIT,Take the reed switch and carefully bend the legs. Caution: The glass tube is very sensitive; bend it so far that you can insert the reed switch into the holes at SW1. The switch has no direction; only insert the switch until the wires are slightly sticking out of the holes on the other side; solder everything in place. Tip: You can also solder from the top instead of the back.
images/PXL_20250306_131117225-EDIT,Take the battery holder. This has one direction. The outline of the battery holder is drawn on the circuit board. Insert it into the holes at BT1{,} so that the outline matches the battery holder;Solder the battery holder from the other side;You are finished with the soldering work. Insert a CR2032 battery.
images/PXL_20250306_130829598,Take the egg cup and remove any plastic residue from the edge or the hole in the middle.;Glue the neodymium magnet into the recess. The direction does not matter.
images/PXL_20250306_131417393,Take the egg and drill a hole centered in the bottom part with a 5mm drill bit;
images/PXL_20250306_132514455,Insert the circuit board with the long protruding LED from the inside through the hole you have just drilled.;Make sure that the reed switch touches the egg shell from the inside.;Fix the circuit board with 2-3 (hot) glue dots.;Then attach the top of the egg.
images/thumbnail,Now insert the egg with the LED facing downwards into the egg cup.;The LED should fit through the hole in the middle of the egg cup.;Now attach the fire jet from below with hot glue. Make sure that you don't glue the LED on as well; you're done! Turn the egg to switch it on.
