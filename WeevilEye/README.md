# Weevil Eye soldering set - LEDbeetle with sensor


The kit is a very easy kit with push-through parts, which is explicitly aimed at beginners. It has only a few parts, so even small children can easily assemble it. Once assembled, the red LED “eyes” light up brighter or dimmer depending on how much light falls on the photo sensor.
