images/PXL_20231106_145956114-EDIT,First solder in the resistors R1{,} R3 and R4.;Resistors have no direction.;R1 has the color code: \usePart{R1} and goes where it says 47k. R3 and R4 have the color code (\usePart{R3} and go to the place marked 220R.
images/PXL_20231106_150158005-EDIT,Solder in the photoresistor R2;The photoresistor also has no direction.
images/PXL_20231106_150409924-EDIT,Solder the transistor at Q1.;Note that a transistor has a flat side. The flat side belongs in the same place as printed on the board.;You have to offer the middle leg a little backwards to get all three legs into the holes.;Make sure that there is no solder bridge.
images/PXL_20231106_150541099-EDIT,Solder in the two LEDs;Attention: LEDs also have a direction. The longer leg of the LEDs marks the positive side.;The positive side is marked with a round pad on the circuit board.;Insert the long leg into the round hole and the short leg into the rectangular hole.
images/PXL_20231106_150658544-EDIT,Now turn the beetle over;Solder on the battery holder;Note that this also has a direction. The shape of the battery holder is printed on the circuit board. Solder the battery holder in exactly the same way.
images/thumbnail,You're done!; Insert a battery (the + must point upwards) and let the beetle light up by placing your finger on the photo resistor; You can also attach a magnet to the battery{,} to better attach the soldering kit to your clothing.
