images/teileuebersicht,Check that all parts are present.
images/zuschneiden,Pull the tape measure completely out of the dispenser and unhook it at the end.;Allow the spring to spring back into the dispenser.;Cut off the metal plate at the end of the tape measure.;Cut 4 pieces of the following lengths: \SI{1}x\SI{355}{\mm}{,} \SI{2}x\SI{150}{\mm}{,} \SI{1}x\SI{304}{\mm};Round the corners of the pieces slightly;Mark the middle of the two long pieces with a pencil.
images/schleifen,Grind off the paint at the non-rounded end of the two short pieces of measuring tape to a length of about \SI{2}{\cm}.
images/loeten1,Take the circuit board and the SMA socket;Solder the SMA socket to the circuit board;Make sure that all solder joints are clean and firmly soldered.
images/loeten2,Apply a generous amount of solder to the large solder pads on the board;Apply sufficient solder to the side of the measuring tapes that is bent outwards;Then solder the measuring tapes to the board;Tip: Use a little extra solder to improve the heat transfer between the soldering iron and the measuring tape;Make sure that the measuring tapes are aligned parallel to each other.
images/schlauch,Now take the irrigation hose;Cut the hose into \SI{9} pieces with the following lengths: \SI{4}x\SI{15}{\mm}{,} \SI{2}x\SI{25}{\mm}{,} \SI{1}x\SI{100}{\mm}{,} \SI{1}x\SI{65}{\mm}{,} \SI{1}x\SI{75}{\mm}.
images/gewindestange,Attach one end of the \SI{75}{\mm} hose to a 4-way manifold;Insert a piece of \SI{15}{\mm} hose into each of the two side connections (at a 90Â° angle);Attach the \SI{65}{\mm} hose to the free end;Attach the next 4-way manifold to the end of this hose. Attach two \SI{25}{\mm}-long hose sections to its side connections. Attach the \SI{100}{\mm} hose to the remaining free end. Attach another 4-way manifold to the side connections. Attach the two remaining \SI{15}{\mm} hose sections to its side connections. Now push the threaded rod through the long hose sections.
images/kleber,Push the threaded rod on one side into the tube{,} so that it is flush with its end;Cut off the excess on the opposite side;Glue both ends with a little hot glue.
images/schrumpfschlauch1,Cut the short heat-shrink tubing with adhesive into equal pieces; place the tape measure sections on the distributors of the tubing construction: the strip with the circuit board belongs in the middle{,} the long strip on the side with the protruding tubing and the medium-length strip on the side with the short end.
images/schrumpfschlauch2,Now slide the shrink tubes over the measuring tapes from the outside; once they are positioned over the distributors{,} shrink them tight; make sure that the measuring tapes are centered - use the markings as a guide.
images/schrumpfschlauch3,Cut the long shrink tubing into \SI{6} pieces; these should be long enough to reach from the center of the antenna to just above the ends of the measuring tapes.
images/thumbnail,Now shrink the long shrink tubes onto the measuring tapes;Make sure that the ends of the measuring tapes do not protrude{,} as they can be very sharp.
