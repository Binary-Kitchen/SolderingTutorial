images/C8206660,Mount the side-elements of the box to the biggest plate without holes; Put the wooden element with \SI{5}{\mm} hole matrix onto the box; Hint: The \SI{5}{\mm} hole matrix will be our soldering help;
images/C8206665,The LED cube consist of 27 RGB LEDs in three 3x3 LED levels; The long leg of the LED is the positive side; Push the LEDs into the plate{,} as shown in the diagram; The '+' and '-' indicates the positive and negative pole of the LED; The arrow is used in the next step,\centering\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{images/CubeDIP_scheme.pdf}
images/C8206668,Bend all negative pins in the direction of the arrows shown in the diagram; The positive and negativ pins should not touch each other; All negativ pins should touch another negative pin on another LED; Solder all negative pins;Carefully push out the layer of the LED cube;
images/C8206670,Repeat step 2 and 3 two times; You should now have three layers with 9 LEDs each; For just layer two and three, bend \SI{2}{\mm} of the tip of all positive pins with an \SI{90}{\degree} angel towards the negative pin.
images/C8206677,Keep the third layer in the hole matrix; Put the second layer of LEDs onto the third layer so that all lines match each other; The bent tips of the positive pins should now touch the positive pins of the third layer; Solder all positive pins of both layers; Carefully push out the soldered layers
images/C8206679,Repeat the steps for soldering the first layer with the staight positive pins; Push out the completed cube
images/C8206681,Glue the two big wooden elements with holes over each other so that all 10 (!) holes are centered and visible; This will be the box lid
images/C8206682,Push the positive pins through the small holes in the plate
images/C8206683,Remove the insulation of the stiff wire completely; Push it through the last hole and connect all negative pins of the three layers; Cut the rest of the wire and down to \SI{5}{\mm} on the other side of the plate
images/C8206685,Solder the inner side of the positive pins as shown in the picture
images/C8206689,Solder the red wire of the battery holder to the midde pin of the switch; Solder a wire to one of the other pins and to the voltage-in (Vi) pin of the step-up
images/C8206693,Solder the voltage-out (Vo) to the postive pin of the LEDs; Connect the black wire of the battery holder to the ground (G) pin of the step-up and the negative pin of the LEDs 
images/C8206694,Screw the switch into the hole in one of the side-elements; Put batteries in; Put the battery holder into the box
images/C8206696,Close the box; You are finished!; To change the batteries{,} open the box on the top
