images/IMG_20180903_213031,Mount the side-elements of the box to the bigger plate with the \SI{5}{\mm} hole matrix; Hint: The \SI{5}{\mm} hole matrix will be on the bottom in the end; The side elements with logo and hole should be opposite each other.
images/IMG_20180903_213233,The LED cube consist of 27 RGB LEDs in three 3x3 LED levels; The long leg of the LED is the positive side; Push the LEDs into the plate{,} as shown in the diagram; The '+' and '-' indicates the positive and negative pole of the LED; The arrow is used in the next step,\centering\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{images/CubeDIP_scheme.pdf}
images/IMG_20180903_213744,Bend all negative pins in the direction of the arrows shown in the diagram; The positive and negativ pins should not touch each other; All negativ pins should touch another negative pin on another LED; Solder all negative pins
images/IMG_20180903_213838,Bend \SI{2}{\mm} of the tip of all positive pins with an \SI{90}{\degree} angel towards the negative pin
images/IMG_20180903_214347,Carefully push out the first layer of the LED cube
images/IMG_20180903_213744,Repeat the steps for the second layer
images/IMG_20180903_215407,Keep the second layer in the hole matrix; Put the first layer of LEDs onto the second layer so that all lines match each other; The bended tips of the positive pins should now touch the positive pins of the second layer; Solder all positive pins of both layers; Carefully push out the soldered layers
images/IMG_20180903_213744,Repeat the steps for soldering the third layer{,} exept do not bend the tips of the positive pins in the third Layer!; Push out the third layer
images/IMG_20180903_221855,Put back the already soldered two layers from before in the hole matrix; Match now the third layer onto the other two; Solder the third layer; Push out the finished cube
images/IMG_20180903_221855,You are finished with all three layers; Push the positive Pins through the small holes in the other plate
images/IMG_20180903_222033,Remove the insulation of the stiff wire completely; Push it through the last hole and connect alle negativ pins of the three layers; Cut the rest of wire and leave a rest of \SI{5}{\mm} on the other side of the plate
images/IMG_20180903_222738,Solder the inner side of the positive pins as shown in the picture
images/IMG_20180903_223809,Sodler the red wire of the battery holder to the midde pin of the switch; Solder a wire to one of the other pins and to the voltage-in (Vi) pin of the step-up
images/IMG_20181203_191431,Solder the voltage-out (Vo) to the postive pin of the LEDs; Connect the black wire of the battery holder to the ground (G) pin of the step-up and the negative pin of the LEDs 
images/IMG_20180903_224135,Screw the switch into the hole in one of the side-elements; Put batteries in; Put the battery holder into the box
images/IMG_20180903_225030,Close the box; You are finished!; To change the batteries{,} open the box on the side or on the top
