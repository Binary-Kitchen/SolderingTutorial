images/verschiedenArt_Schmuck_loeten_4_RingGeloetet,Heat the solder joint you just made again with the soldering iron.;Take the ring with the tweezers and press it with one side into the liquid solder so that the ring extends as far as possible beyond the ends of the legs.;The small ring or the earring hook will later be attached to this.

The legs on the other side should also touch each other.;Heat the legs at the solder joint with the soldering iron for about 4 seconds.;Then hold the solder to the heated spot and the soldering iron and connect the legs together with the melting solder.;Alternatively{,} you can also solder the ends of the legs together without a ring and bend the last 4-5 mm of the LED legs at a 90° angle{,} so that they form a horizontal edge.

images/VerschiedenArt-Schmuck-loeten-Beispiel2-scaled,If you like{,} you can now decorate your jewelry pendant with small decorative pendants.;Just make sure that the decorative elements{,} if they are made of metal{,} do not get between the LEDs and their legs and connect + and - there{,} causing a short circuit.;If there are still small pointed ends of the LEDs or solder protruding{,} you can carefully cut them off with side cutters.
