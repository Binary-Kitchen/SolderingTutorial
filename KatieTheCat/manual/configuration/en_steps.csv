images/PXL_20220805_171906861, Turn the board on its backside.;On the board you will find R1 and R2.; There you have to solder the resistors (blue sticks with coloured squiggles).;Add solder to all four golden pads that are connected with a line and R1 or R2.; For this you have to heat the golden pads with the soldering iron and melt solder on them.
images/PXL_20220805_163059475, The coloured squiggles on the resistors show the value of the resistor. One resistor has no direction.;The resistor \usePart{R1} (\SI{750}{\ohm}) goes on R1.;The resistor \usePart{R2} (\SI{47}{\ohm}) goes on R2.;To do this{,} reheat the solder on one of the pads and then push the wire of the right resistor into the hot solder.;Do this with all four pads and the respective resistors.;Cut off the overhanging wire pieces.
images/PXL_20220805_164535236,The button has no direction.;Add solder to both pads on the left and right of the button (SW1).;Bend the legs of the button so{,} that the legs can touch the surface of the board{,} when the button is on the board. (See example below left).;Reheat the pad with solder and slide one leg of the button from the side onto the pad.;Make sure that the other leg of the button touches the other pad.;Now solder the second side of the button.
images/PXL_20220805_165513933,LEDs have a positive (+) and negative (-) leg. The long leg of the LED is the positive leg.; the blue LED goes on D1. The green LED goes on D2.; Add solder to the pads of D1 and D2.;Bend the legs so{,} that the tip of the head of the LED points to the hole in the board. The long leg should be able to touch the + pad (see the picture above for an example).;Solder the positive leg (the long one) to the positive pad{,} on which you have already applied solder.;Make sure{,} that the second leg also touches the other pad (-).;Now solder all pads.
images/PXL_20220805_170237225,The battery holder has a direction{,} which is marked with a sloped edge on the outside. The same sloped edge is also printed on the PCB.; Solder the battery holder so that the sloped edges are on the same side.; Put solder on one pad of the battery holder.; Reheat the pad with solder and slide the battery holder from the side onto the pad.; Make sure that the other leg of the battery holder can touch the other pad.; Solder the other leg onto the other pad on the PCB.
images/PXL_20220805_170849782,Insert the battery as shown.;The leg{,} which is facing upwards{,} must touch the top (+) of the battery. Push the battery into the battery holder from the left and press only the left side down.
images/PXL_20220805_170955277,You are done!; You can add a magnet to the battery{,} to better attach Katie to your clothes.
