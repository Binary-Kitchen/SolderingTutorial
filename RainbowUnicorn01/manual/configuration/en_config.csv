   \item Keep these assembly instructions in a safe place for future reference! They contain important information.
   \item If the battery runs out, replace it with a new battery with the same specifications.
   \item During soldering, the soldering iron, solder, and components being soldered become very hot.
   \item ALWAYS wear safety goggles when soldering and assembling the kit.
   \item Always use a fireproof surface when soldering! This prevents the components from slipping.

If this happens, seek medical attention immediately.
