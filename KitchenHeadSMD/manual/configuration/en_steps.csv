images/DSC04829,Tape the board onto the soldering mat;
images/DSC04831,Take IC1 up with a piece of tape. The tape should cover only half of the chip; Arrange and fix the IC to the correct position on the board;Careful - Direction is important: The small dot on the IC has to match with the dot on the board;Solder all pins of the IC to the Board;Take away the tape and fix the pins on the other side;
images/DSC04832,Solder the resistors R2 to R8 on the board;To do so{,} put some solder on ONE pad; Heat up the solder again and slip the resistor onto the pad with the solder; Solder the other side after that;
images/DSC04833,Solder capacitor C2 with the technique showed before;
images/DSC04834,\emph{Be carefull!} The direction of the LEDs is important; Read everything first.; Solder the LED with the technique showed before; On the board are marking points or arrows printed on;The LED has a green marking on top; The dot/arrow shows the direction where the green marking has to be directed while soldering; Hint: If you can not identify the arror or dot on the board look at the drawing at the end of this manual,\centering\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{../../misc/led_drawing/smd_led_up.pdf}
images/DSC04835,Solder switch S1 to the board;
images/DSC04836,Solder the battery holder to the board; For this{,} turn around the board; Battery holder and board have a + printed on. They have to match; Note: Start with the plus pole;Now insert battery and push the switch; Be careful: One metal arm of the battery holder has to reach on the top side (see picture);
